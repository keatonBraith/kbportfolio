          <p>
            Hi, I'm Keaton Braithwaite! I'm a software developer who
            loves to create and design websites and applications that are
            meaningful to people. Coming from a sales background and having
            helped build a pool construction company from the ground up I know
            how to work and am eager to learn. I am also a father of 3 beautiful
            children and husband to an amazing wife. I love the mountains here
            in Utah and exploring the many areas to hike. I'm a big sports
            enthusiast and enjoy playing football, basketball , pickleball and
            more.
